## Probot: Scheduler

A [Probot](https://github.com/probot/probot) extension to trigger events on an hourly schedule.

## Usage

```js
const createScheduler = require('probot-scheduler');

module.exports = app => {
  scheduler = createScheduler(app);

  app.on('schedule.repository', context => {
    // this event is triggered on an interval, which is 1 hr by default;
  });
};
```

## Configuration

There are a few environment variables that can change the behavior of the scheduler:

- `DISABLE_DELAY=true` - Perform the schedule immediately on startup, instead of waiting for the random delay between 0 and 59:59 for each repository, which exists to avoid all schedules being performed at the same time.

- `IGNORED_ACCOUNTS=comma,separated,list` - GitHub usernames to ignore when scheduling. These are typically spammy or abusive accounts.
